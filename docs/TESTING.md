# Testing Poker Payout

Everything here runs headless on a Linux workstation: no phone, no emulator window, no
sound. It is written so that a person *or* an AI agent can run it unattended.

| Tier | Command | Needs | Typical time |
|------|---------|-------|--------------|
| JVM unit tests | `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` | JDK 21 | ~45 s warm |
| Device smoke tour (screenshots + UI dumps + logcat) | `scripts/device/tour.sh` | emulator (auto-booted) | ~6 min incl. build |
| Instrumented tests | `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` | running emulator | ~11 min (currently fails to compile, see below) |
| JVM screenshot tests (Roborazzi) | not set up yet | n/a | n/a |

## 1. Prerequisites

* Linux with KVM (`$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -accel-check` should say KVM is usable;
  your user must be in the `kvm` group).
* Android SDK at `$ANDROID_HOME` (default `~/Android/Sdk`) with `emulator/`,
  `platform-tools/` and the system image
  `system-images/android-34/google_apis_playstore/x86_64`. No `cmdline-tools`
  (avdmanager/sdkmanager) are needed: `boot.sh` writes the AVD files itself, and Gradle
  downloads missing `platforms;android-34` on first build.
* JDK 21 (all modules use `jvmToolchain(21)`; bytecode still targets 17). Commits from
  before the switch to JDK 21 need a JDK 17 toolchain that Gradle can find, for example one
  under `~/.gradle/jdks/` with a `.ready` marker file.
* `python3` (stdlib only) and `bash`.

The scripts set `ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_SERIAL` themselves. Nothing has to be on `PATH`.

## 2. Quick start

```bash
scripts/device/tour.sh              # boot if needed, build, install, tour, write the report
scripts/device/tour.sh --no-build   # reuse the last debug APK (fast iteration on the tour)
scripts/device/tour.sh --stop       # also shut the emulator down at the end
scripts/device/stop.sh              # shut the emulator down
```

stdout is a short summary, one line per step. The tour exits non-zero if any step fails:

```
[device] already running: emulator-5580 (14, API 34)
[device] built :app:assembleDebug in 38s
[device] installed PokerPayout-v1.1.12-debug.apk (19M) in 1s
[tour] PASS 01-launch (7.6s)
...
[tour] PASS: 36/36 steps passed, 0 fatal, 0 ANR, 337s total
[tour] report: build/device-reports/20261004-185201/index.md
```

## 3. Output layout

```
build/device-reports/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/     (build/device-reports/latest -> newest run)
  index.md            verdict, device, timings, one table row per step with its screenshot
  NN-<step>.png       1080x2400 screenshot after the step
  NN-<step>.xml       uiautomator UI tree after the step (text, content-desc, bounds, flags)
  logcat.txt          full logcat for the run (cleared at the start)
  logcat-crash.txt    crash buffer only
  tour.log            every ui.py action, assertion, and per-dump timing
build/device/                               (scratch state for the scripts)
  emulator.log  emulator.pid  settings.log  gradle-debug.log  install.log  shots/
```

To review a run, an agent opens `index.md`, then looks at each `NN-*.png` with its image
viewer (Claude Code's `Read` tool renders PNGs). For exact text, bounds, or
enabled/disabled state, it reads the matching `.xml` file.

## 4. The scripts (`scripts/device/`)

All the scripts are bash with `set -euo pipefail`. They share `lib.sh`. Detailed logs go to
files and stdout stays short.

| Script | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `boot.sh [--cold\|--wipe]` | Starts the emulator headless (`-no-window -no-audio -no-boot-anim -gpu swiftshader_indirect`), waits for `sys.boot_completed` and a responsive package manager, then applies the deterministic settings below. Idempotent: if the emulator is already up, it only re-applies the settings. It creates the dedicated AVD `pokerpayout_test` (API 34, 1080x2400 @ 420 dpi, 2 GB RAM, 4 cores) on first use. Any other AVD selected with `PP_AVD` is started `-read-only`, so nobody else's AVD is ever changed. |
| `stop.sh [--force]` | `adb emu kill` (saves a quick-boot snapshot); `--force` sends SIGKILL instead. |
| `install.sh [--release] [--no-build] [--clear]` | `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` (or `assembleRelease`), then `adb install -r`. If the signatures don't match, it uninstalls and installs again. |
| `shot.sh <name> [outdir] [--ui]` | `adb exec-out screencap -p` to `<outdir>/<name>.png` (default `build/device/shots`), checks the PNG signature, and also writes the UI dump when given `--ui`. |
| `ui.py` | Stdlib-only UI driver over `uiautomator dump` + `adb shell input` (see below). |
| `tour.sh` | The one-command smoke tour (section 5). |

Deterministic device settings applied by `boot.sh`:

* all three animation scales set to 0
* en-US locale (verified; changing it needs root), UTC timezone, 24 h clock
* show-touches and pointer-location off
* screen always on, keyguard dismissed
* rotation locked to portrait, font scale 1.0
* spell checker and autofill off
* no Play Protect prompts on adb installs
* SystemUI demo mode: the clock is pinned to 12:00, battery shows 100 %, notifications are hidden
* Wi-Fi and mobile data off, because the app needs no network and this keeps Play services quiet. Set `PP_KEEP_NETWORK=1` to keep them on.

Environment knobs: `ANDROID_HOME`, `PP_AVD` (default `pokerpayout_test`), `PP_EMU_PORT`
(default `5580`, so the serial is `emulator-5580` and it never collides with a hand-launched
emulator on 5554), `PP_GPU`, `PP_BOOT_TIMEOUT` (default 300 s), `PP_TIMEZONE`,
`PP_REPORT_ROOT`.

Measured on this machine (24 cores, KVM): boot with no snapshot takes about 25 s,
`boot.sh` on an already running emulator takes about 1 s, a warm `assembleDebug` takes
about 40 s, and an install takes about 1 s.

### ui.py: driving the app by hand

Each command takes a fresh `uiautomator dump` (about 2 s; the dump waits about 1 s for the
UI to go idle) and polls until its target appears or `--timeout` runs out (default 10 s).
Compose exposes `Text` and `contentDescription` to uiautomator, so selectors use those.
No test tags are needed today.

```bash
D=scripts/device
$D/ui.py launch --clear                      # force-stop + clear data + start the launcher activity
$D/ui.py texts                               # every visible text/content-desc, top to bottom
$D/ui.py dump --out /tmp/screen.xml          # compact tree on stdout; raw XML to a file
$D/ui.py tap text=Tools                      # exact text
$D/ui.py tap "desc=Start timer"              # exact content-description
$D/ui.py tap Odds                            # bare token: text or desc ==, else contains
$D/ui.py tap "has=A|♠" --scroll-in scrollable   # smallest node containing both labels (a card)
$D/ui.py set-text 'text=Buy-in ($)' --value 25  # tap field, clear it, type
$D/ui.py enter                               # IME action (commits Bank player names)
$D/ui.py slide class=SeekBar --frac 0.3      # tap a slider at 30 % of its track
$D/ui.py scroll down --times 2 | scroll-to "text~=High Card"
$D/ui.py wait 're=^[0-9]+\.[0-9]{2}%$' --timeout 60
$D/ui.py assert-text "Calculate Odds" "text~=Community Cards (0/5)"
$D/ui.py wait-gone "Select a Card"
$D/ui.py back | home | key KEYCODE_TAB
$D/shot.sh my-screen /tmp/shots --ui
```

Selector tokens can be combined (`"text=Player 1" class=EditText`). The available tokens are
`text=`, `text~=` (contains, case-insensitive), `desc=`, `desc~=`, `id=`, `class=`, `re=`
(regex on text or desc), `has=A|B`, and the flags `clickable`, `scrollable`, `focused`,
`checked`, `enabled`. `--index N` picks the Nth match in reading order. When a lookup
fails, ui.py exits 1 and prints what *is* on screen, which is usually enough to fix the
selector.

If you later add `Modifier.testTag(...)`, you also need
`Modifier.semantics { testTagsAsResourceId = true }` near the root composable (gate it on
`ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE` so release builds don't change). The tags then show up as
`resource-id` and work with `id=`.

## 5. The smoke tour

`tour.sh` starts from cleared app data and visits every screen and tool. Each step is a
bash function of `ui.py` calls that ends in assertions. The steps are:

1. **Tournament.** Launch; enter buy-in 25 and bounty 5; move the players slider; open the
   Blinds tab; collapse the config; start the timer; skip a level; pause; open the reset
   dialog and confirm it.
2. **Bank.** Rename Player 1 to Alice and commit with Enter; confirm a buy-in (the dialog
   must say "Alice has paid"); knock out Player 2; open the payout-weights editor; open the
   pool-summary dialog; scroll.
3. **Tools.** Open the grid and the Settings tile (volume dialog).
4. **Odds.** Empty state; card picker; AsKs vs QhQd; a JsTs2c flop (the picker scrolls to
   find 2c); run the Monte Carlo calculation and wait for `NN.NN%`; switch to 4 players; reset.
5. **Hand rankings, then the chip calculator.** In the chip calculator: Generate, open the
   advanced settings, scroll.
6. Back to Tournament, then check that the app process is still alive.

After every step, the tour fails it if logcat's crash buffer has a `FATAL EXCEPTION` for the
app or if an `ANR in com.huntercoles.pokerpayout` appears. Use `--keep-going` to run all
steps even after a failure.

To add a step, write `s_my_step() { ui tap ...; ui assert-text ...; }` and register it with
`step my-step "description" s_my_step`. End steps with an assertion: the tour then reuses
that UI dump for the step's `.xml`, which saves a second dump.

## 6. JVM unit tests

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4g        # all modules
./gradlew :tools-feature:testDebugUnitTest --tests '*TexasHoldemOdds*'
```

Reports: `<module>/build/reports/tests/testDebugUnitTest/index.html`. JUnit XML is in
`<module>/build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest/`.

The `core`, `bank-feature` and `tools-feature` modules use the `de.mannodermaus.android-junit5`
plugin (JUnit Platform). `tournament-feature` does not. Know these pitfalls about the current setup:

* **Tests that are silently skipped.** No `junit-vintage-engine` is on the classpath, so
  JUnit4-style tests (`org.junit.Test`, including every Robolectric test) never run in the
  three JUnit5 modules. In `tournament-feature` the reverse happens: the JUnit5
  `TimerViewModelTest` never runs. That is 54 tests in total. The build stays green and shows
  no warning.
* **Duplicated tests.** `bank-feature` and `tools-feature` add `core/src/test` as a source
  dir, so core's 72 tests run three times.

## 7. Instrumented tests

```bash
scripts/device/boot.sh
ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5580 ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest --continue -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4g
scripts/device/install.sh --no-build     # connected* tasks uninstall the app afterwards
```

Right now this fails at compile time. `bank-feature`'s `PlayerRowLayoutTest` uses a private
`PlayerRow` and wrong imports, and `tournament-feature`'s `DecimalTextFieldTest` is missing
new `PoolConfigurationSection` parameters. The other modules have 0 instrumented tests.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `Cannot find a Java installation ... languageVersion=21` (or 17 on old commits) | Install that JDK. Gradle auto-detects `/usr/lib/jvm/*` and `~/.gradle/jdks/*` (the latter only with a `.ready` marker file). |
| `SDK location not found` | The scripts export `ANDROID_HOME`. For plain `./gradlew`, run `export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk` or create a `local.properties` (it is gitignored). |
| `boot timed out` / `emulator process exited during boot` | Read `build/device/emulator.log`. Check KVM with `emulator -accel-check`. Make sure no other emulator holds the AVD (`pgrep -af qemu`). Try `boot.sh --cold`, or `boot.sh --wipe` for a corrupted snapshot or userdata. |
| `adb: device offline` right after boot | This is transient; `boot.sh` waits for the package manager. If it persists: `adb kill-server` and run `boot.sh` again. |
| Stale lock after a crash (`multiinstance.lock`, `*.lock` in `~/.android/avd/pokerpayout_test.avd/`) | Run `stop.sh --force`, delete the `*.lock` files in the test AVD, and boot again. |
| `uiautomator dump failed: could not get idle state` | Something animates forever. Animations are off globally, so look for an infinite Compose animation. ui.py retries 4 times. |
| A white bar with a keyboard icon at the bottom of screenshots | The IME switcher shows while a text field has focus (the emulator has a hardware keyboard, so no soft keyboard appears). Press `ui.py enter` or navigate away to drop focus. |
| App missing after `connectedDebugAndroidTest` | Expected: the test tasks uninstall it. Run `install.sh --no-build`. |
| Text assertions fail on another machine | Run `boot.sh` again: it re-applies the settings and warns if the locale is not en-US. |
| Port clash with another emulator | `PP_EMU_PORT=5590 scripts/device/tour.sh` (even numbers 5554-5682). |
| Low RAM | The emulator uses about 2 GB. The scripts cap Gradle at `-Xmx4g` and the Kotlin daemon at 2 GB. Run one Gradle build at a time. |

## 9. Next tier: JVM screenshot tests (proposal)

Roborazzi (with Robolectric native graphics) would render composables to PNG in a plain
JVM test, with no emulator and in seconds. It would compare them to golden images committed
under `src/test/screenshots`. An agent would run `./gradlew verifyRoborazziDebug`, read
`build/test-results/roborazzi/results-summary.json`, and open the `*_compare.png` diffs for
any failures. The versions that fit this toolchain, and the setup steps, are in the
device-harness report. In short: Roborazzi **1.60.0**, the last release whose Kotlin
metadata Kotlin 2.0.21 can read, plus Robolectric 4.14.1 and the JUnit vintage engine.
