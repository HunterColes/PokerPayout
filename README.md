### **Blind Structure Engine**
The blind timer now generates a full tournament-ready blind schedule using your tournament inputs:

- Player count is read from the Tournament settings panel
- Duration, smallest chip, starting stack, and round length values drive the schedule
- Blinds increase between 33% and 100% each step and snap to casino-standard chip values
- The final big blind is always at least double the starting stack value to force decisive play
- Extra ‚Äúsudden-death‚Äù levels are appended only when needed to finish near the target duration (duration + ~1 hour)
- The timer screen shows the active level, time until the next level, and a preview of upcoming levels
- Arrow controls let you jump between levels; tapping back on level one performs a full timer reset
